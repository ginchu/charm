    "In this homework, your goal is to predict the solubility of a compound, and to reach to lowest possible error on the test set. To make this homework a little more interactive, you should report your score on a scoreboard: https://keepthescore.co/board/cmdaqeorufe/ <br> For this homework, you will use a library called score, which provides you with 3 functions. \n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> featurize(dataset,features): dataset should be a CSV file with at least two columns: SMILES and Solubility. features should be a list of mordred features. Returns two numpy tensors, one with the result of the feature calculation, one with the target. \n",
    "    <li> test(features,model): features should be a list of mordred features. model should be a scikit learn estimator. return the mean average error on the test set.\n",
    "    <li> report(teamname): teaname should be your team name, per the canvas group assignment. Effect: records your current score on the scoreboard.\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "At the end of this notebook, you will find an example on how to train a model, test it, and report a score. Note that you are allowed to use my featurize function for your featurization. If you want to use 3D features, please contact me. You should use datasets A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I for your work. You are encouraged to use multiple datasets!<br>\n",
    "One final note: you will not be graded based on the scoreboard. Of course, there might be some anticorrelation between your test score and your grade, but you need not worry about the scoreboard."

    ": *This is the number of rings within a molecule. Our settings include all ring types (aromatic/non-aromatic, carbon or other). Based on the type of ring and number of rings present within a molecule, the solubility will be affected. Rings can reveal information about bonding available. Aromatic rings generally decrease solubility, but substitutions onto the ring can drastically change things.*\n",

    ": *Log S is a feature designed to predict solubility in water for a given molecule. The log portion refers to the log of the molarity of a molecule. Filter It is a program that filters out molecules with undesirable qualities.*\n",

    ": *Topological surface area is the sum of all polar regions of a molecule (oxygens, nitrogens, and attached hydrogens). This is basically a map of polarity (ie “like dissolves like” and to what degree this would happen in a particular situation).*"
